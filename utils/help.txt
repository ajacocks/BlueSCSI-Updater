** Option [1] - Upgrade via USB

Take a look at your LOG.txt from your BlueSCSI - if the version has "-USB" in it you can use this option to upgrade your firmware with just a USB cable!

** Option [2] - Prepare a blank BluePill or older BlueSCSI firmware for USB support.

If you have a non "-USB" firmware or a unflashed BluePill on your BlueSCSI - this option will allow you to flash the USB bootloader and BlueSCSI firmware.

This option requires a STLink V2 programmer.
